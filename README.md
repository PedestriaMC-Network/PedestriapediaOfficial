# Pedestriapedia Official ยง The official wiki for PedestriaMC
Welcome to the official wiki for PedestriaMC. We would like to thank you for checking us out! Currently it is not open-source, due to the pages needed net being currently setup yet, as well as no staff has been hired, and permissions for editing have not been setup either. In the meantime, as the owner of this wiki, I would like to thank you for your patience, as we get setup around here on Pedestriapedia Official!

    Best Wishes,
          Lukas Batema (Java Gamertag: GameHogPlays, Bedrock Gamertag: *GameHogPlays)
