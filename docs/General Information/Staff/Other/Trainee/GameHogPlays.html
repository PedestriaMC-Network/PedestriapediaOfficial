    <h3>[Trainee] GameHogPlays, [S] *GameHogPlays</h3>
    <h5>Background</h5>
      <p>I am a 15 year old male. I am a decently fast speedcuber, which means I can solve the Rubik's Cube pretty fast. I also taught myself many programming languages, including, but not limited to: HTML, Swift, CSS, and C++. </p>
    <h5>Creating the Wiki</h5>
      <p>I'm pretty sure the idea for a wiki for PedestriaMC was already thought of, but I put it into action. It started as an idea in my head, when I was first invited to the server by bvsy. I then decided to document what happens in that server, but I quickly saw it was a waste of my time, and proceeded to leave the server. It was about two weeks later when I joined again. I then decided to start documenting it again. It was only a matter of time before I asked <a href="https://wiki.pedestriamc.com/General%20Information/Owners/wiicart.html">[Owner] wiicart</a> if I could make a wiki for PedestriaMC. 
I went ahead and direct messaged <a href="https://wiki.pedestriamc.com/General%20Information/Owners/wiicart.html">[Owner] wiicart</a> on Discord, asking if I could make a wiki for his Minecraft server. His answer is summed up by a yes. The next day I started my work on it and it took me about a half of a day to put together the file system and basic structure. He approved on how it was turning out and let me proceed with the project.</p>
    <h5>Trivia</h5>

        <li>Did you know that [Trainee] GameHogPlays is the only one with the WikiLord prefix?</li>
