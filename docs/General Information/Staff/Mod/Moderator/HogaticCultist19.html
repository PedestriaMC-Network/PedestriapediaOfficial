    <h5>Background</h5>
    <p>I am a 15 year old male. I am a decently fast speedcuber, which means I can solve the Rubik's Cube pretty fast. I
      also taught myself many programming languages, including, but not limited to: HTML, Swift, CSS, and C++. </p>
    <h5>Creating the Wiki</h5>
    <p>I'm pretty sure the idea for a wiki for PedestriaMC was already thought of, but I put it into action. It started as
      an idea in my head, when I was first invited to the server by bvsy. I then decided to document what happens in that
      server, but I quickly saw it was a waste of my time, and proceeded to leave the server. It was about two weeks later
      when I joined again. I then decided to start documenting it again. It was only a matter of time before I asked <a
        href="https://wiki.pedestriamc.com/General%20Information/Owners/wiicart.html">[Owner] wiicart</a> if I could make
      a wiki for PedestriaMC.
      I went ahead and direct messaged <a
        href="https://wiki.pedestriamc.com/General%20Information/Owners/wiicart.html">[Owner] wiicart</a> on Discord,
      asking if I could make a wiki for his Minecraft server. His answer is summed up by a yes. The next day I started my
      work on it and it took me about a half of a day to put together the file system and basic structure. He approved on
      how it was turning out and let me proceed with the project.</p>
