    <h3>[Builder/Moderator] Randomy</h3>
    <h5>Bio</h5>
    <p>Randomy is a staff member for Pedestria. He’s a former IDMC player and also became a former Cubtime player shortly after it also shut down.
    
      Appearance<br>
      Randomy’s Minecraft skin is the Minecraft console edition Developer Steve skin with a different face texture and hair.
      On some occasions, his skin can reference other games or characters, such as Luigi from Super Mario Bros and Jotaro
      from JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure.<br><br>
    
      Accomplishments<br>
      Randomy has accomplished AFKing at public Iron Golem farms for 14 hours in order for him to get to /baltop 2 on
      Cubtime
      survival, repaired many abandoned towns in IDMC, became the first person to kill the ender dragon during the opening
      day
      of Pedestria (October 2020), and successfully founded Oakshores and Theiance.
      <br><br>
      Relationships<br>
      Randomy is on good terms with most players on the server, and provides everyone his public IG and EG farms. The
      players
      he assists the most are the ones that have builds at Theiance, such as stql (German), LavenderLuna, DarthCreeper27,
      and
      meow_cat3, or are members of Oakshores, which are Furious_G, ThatRatLord, MelonicToaster, Monkey_Marley, and
      MelonicOverlord.<br><br>
    
      PvP<br>
      Randomy is below average when it comes to combat, such as the lack of combos he can use on his opponents, and the weak
      weapons he uses. Currently, he has died 779 times and only has 99 kills. Monkey_Marley is the majority of the 99 kills
      he has.<br><br>
